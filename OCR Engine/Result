Wikipedia is an online free-content encyclopedia project that aims to help create a world in which everyone can
freely share in the sum of all knowledge. It is supported by the Wikimedia Foundation and based on a model of
openly editable content, The name “Wikipedia” is a blending of the words wiki (a technology for creating
collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning “quick") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles
provide links designed to guide the user to related pages with additional information.

Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers who write without pay. Anyone with intemet
access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to
prevent disruption or vandalism.
